This repository contains the FORTRAN source files for compiling the MFV3d MHD code and also includes a suitable version of SPLASH 
for visualizing the output. The code is an implementation of the moving finite volume method in 3 dimensions which also includes a tree code for simulating self-gravitating plasmas. 
The moving finite volume method is a meshfree method which discretizes the MHD equations on a moving grid.
It combines features of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics codes and AMR codes.
